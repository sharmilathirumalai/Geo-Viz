# Commercial Fishing Hot Predictor
A data-driven implementation that uses past data from fishing vessel movements to predict the most likely hotspots for commercial fishing at a given time of the year. The prediction results are visualized as choropleth map.

  Application is live at [Frontend](https://vessel-predictor.herokuapp.com/past) and [Web Service](https://vessel-predictor-backend.herokuapp.com/).

## What are the framework & libraries used ?
This application is built using the following frameworks and libraries :package:.
* [Angular 7](https://angular.io/) - Web application framework
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  - CSS Framework
* [HTML and CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)- Web designing Language
* [Sails JS](https://sailsjs.com/) - MVC Framework to build Web Services.


## What are the prerequisite required ?
 * Node JS - [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 * Angular 7 - [Install](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

## How to run the application ?
1. Clone the repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/sharmilathirumalai/Geo-Viz.git`
3. Navigate to front workspace using `cd Frontend`
4. Launch the app using `ng serve --open`
5. Now the application will open in your default browser in following URL [localhost:4200](http:\\localhost:4200\past).


**Note** The above steps will succeed only if the prerequisite platforms are installed in your local machine.


## Application tour :rocket:
Now let us go for around to visit the above pages.

* The application by default will open the *past trends* when served :checkered_flag: . Here we will show the trnds for 1st week of 2012.
* Now to go to prediction, you'll have to click on the *prediction menu* in the top navbar :checkered_flag:.
